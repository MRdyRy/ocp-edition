This repository contains information about OpenShift. In this tutorial, Iâ€™m using OpenShift Local (CRC).

The topics I want to discuss here are:
- How to install CRC
- Creating a user
- Adding policies to a user
- Creating a project
- Granting project access to a user
- Deploying apps
- Exposing applications
- Scaling apps
- Setting up Ingress
- Rolling out applications
- Setting up alerts with Prometheus

Project Use Case:
- Automatically roll out pods when resource usage reaches the limit, triggered by a Prometheus alert.
